Finally, done with AWS SAA certification! 🎉

## Why AWS SAA?

Couple of weeks back, I gave [AWS SAA (Solutions Architect Associate)-C003](https://aws.amazon.com/certification/certified-solutions-architect-associate/) certification exam.
I managed to clear the exam in first attempt.
It took me almost 9 months of persistence to clear the exam.
It took me so long partially due to vastness of syllabus and also balancing the personal and professional commitments.

AWS Certifications give a structure and discipline to study and prepare vast area of cloud computing.
From last few years, I got curious about internals systems working at scale.
I started studying research papers to dive deep into them such as LightHouse, DynamoDB, BigTable, Kubernetes etc.
However, I felt somehow disconnected from the bigger picture of how these systems playing out in real-world applications.
This lead to the urge of knowing about Cloud computing. When it comes to Cloud computing, AWS is the first in mind.
Now to dive into ocean of Cloud computing, I needed a structure. That's where preparation for certification started.

## Preparation

```java
class Hello {
    String hello() {
        return "Hello"
    }
}
```
