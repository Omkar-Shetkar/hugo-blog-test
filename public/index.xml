      <description>&lt;p&gt;Finally, done with AWS SAA certification! 🎉&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;why-aws-saa&#34;&gt;Why AWS SAA?&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Couple of weeks back, I gave AWS SAA (Solutions Architect Associate)-C003 certification exam.&#xA;I managed to clear the exam in first attempt.&#xA;It took me almost 9 months of persistence to clear the exam.&#xA;It took me so long partially due to vastness of syllabus and also balancing the personal and professional commitments.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;AWS Certifications give a structure and discipline to study and prepare vast area of cloud computing.&#xA;From last few years, I got curious about internals systems working at scale.&#xA;I started studying research papers to dive deep into them such as LightHouse, DynamoDB, BigTable, Kubernetes etc.&#xA;However, I felt somehow disconnected from the bigger picture of how these systems playing out in real-world applications.&#xA;This lead to the urge of knowing about Cloud computing. When it comes to Cloud computing, AWS is the first in mind.&#xA;Now to dive into ocean of Cloud computing, I needed a structure. That&amp;rsquo;s where preparation for certification started.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
